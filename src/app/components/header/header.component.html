                    Back around 1985 a handfull of us Programmers had just made the jump 
                    from COBOL to C and were having a blast writing tools
                    and games and toys.
                    One I wrote just randomly toggled pixels 
                    (If the pixel is off: turn it on. If the pixel is off: turn it on)
                        I knew intuitively that while it started
                    out blank, it would
                    start to fill the screen then settle down and hover with around 50% coverage. 
                    I'm sure there is a
                    mathmatical proof but "at a greater than 50% full the odds of hitting an ON 
                    pixel are greater
                    than 50%" is all I can articulate.

                    Turns out this little program is <i>multi-threaded!</i> The more times you click the Go button
                    the more  processes run. And that is just fine.
